# DriveRewards

DriveRewards is a customer loyalty and engagement platform for automotive shops. It helps shop owners drive customer retention with rewards, targeted promotions, and a branded customer portal.

Customers can view their rewards and promotions, track progress toward the next goal, create service appointments, and access their own repair records. This reduces back-and-forth with service advisors, shortens call times, and saves staff time by letting customers self-serve common questions.

## Key Benefits

- Increased customer retention through rewards and personalized promotions
- Fewer inbound calls and faster service by giving customers access to their repair history
- Branded customer experience that reinforces the shop’s identity
- Customer self-scheduling to reduce administrative overhead
